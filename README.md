### 👋 About Me  
I'm a 17 years old C++ developer with a passion for graphics programming and low-level systems. I enjoy building things from the ground up — from rendering to custom tools — and I’m always exploring new ways to make real-time visuals faster, cleaner, and more expressive.  
I care about writing clear, efficient code and designing systems that are both flexible and robust. I occasionally solve problems on LeetCode just for fun.

### 🎯 Current Focus  
- Designing and implementing core game engine systems in C++  
- Building custom tools to streamline the development workflow  
- Practicing algorithms and data structures on LeetCode to strengthen problem-solving skills  

---

### 🛠️ Skills & Technologies  
- **Modern C++ (C++20/23):** Primary language with experience in advanced features and clean design principles
- **Graphics Programming:** OpenGL, GLSL, and linear algebra applied in real-time rendering  
- **Rust:** Familiar with Rust syntax, ownership model, and tooling (Cargo, etc.)

---

### 🚀 Projects  
- [**RodEngine**](https://github.com/Plecaj/RodEngine) — a work-in-progress graphics/game engine in C++.  
- [**PlecakDB**](https://github.com/Plecaj/PlecakDB) — a simple relational database system side project. Currently includes a basic lexer and parser. Development is on pause while I focus on the engine, but I plan to return to it soon.
