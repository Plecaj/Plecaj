### 👋 About Me  
Hey! I’m a 17-year-old developer who loves working with C++. I’m really into graphics programming, low-level systems, and building cool stuff from scratch. I like clean code, smart design, and solving problems just for fun.

---

### 🎯 Current Focus  
- Writing game engine systems in C++
- Practicing algorithms and data structures on LeetCode
- Learning math, especially stuff related to graphics

---

### 🛠️ Skills & Technologies  
- **C++20/23** – My main language, with a focus on modern features and clean design  
- **Graphics Programming** – OpenGL, GLSL, and the math (mostly linear algebra) behind real-time rendering  
- **Rust** – Comfortable with the syntax, ownership model, and tools like Cargo  
- **Git** – Everyday tool for version control and managing projects

---

### 🚀 Projects  
- [**RodEngine**](https://github.com/Plecaj/RodEngine) — a work-in-progress graphics/game engine in C++.  
- [**PlecakDB**](https://github.com/Plecaj/PlecakDB) — a simple relational database system side project. Currently includes a basic lexer and parser. Development is on pause while I focus on the engine, but I plan to return to it soon.
